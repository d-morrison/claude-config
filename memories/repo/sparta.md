# Sparta — working notes

## Website docs scope in stacked PRs

Sparta requires user-facing PRs to update the `website/` docs (the website-update
policy in the repo's `CLAUDE.md`). That requirement makes it easy to over-document:
on a stacked PR, write docs only for features whose code is on the *current branch's*
ancestry, not for a sibling branch's feature.

This is the sparta instance of the general rule in `preferences.md` ("only document
features present on the current branch's ancestry — grep first").

**Concrete case:** in the terrain-speed PR (#185), website docs were written for the
order-response delay feature (from `feat/order-response-delay`, a separate branch also
targeting `main`). That code was never in `feat/terrain-speed`'s ancestry, so the
reviewer correctly flagged it as a "hallucinated feature." Before documenting a feature,
`grep` for its symbol/constant (e.g. `order_response_delay`) on the current branch; if
it's absent, move the docs to the branch where the code lives.
