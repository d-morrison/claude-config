# check-history

Before implementing changes for an issue or MR, review the repository's merge
history to understand what decisions were made previously and why.

## When this fires (automatically)

- Starting work on any issue that involves modifying existing code
- Before proposing changes to CI/CD templates, shared infrastructure, or
  configuration files
- When the change touches code that has been refactored in prior MRs

## First: is the issue already done or in progress?

Before reviewing past history, confirm the issue still needs a *new* PR. Two
checks (skipping them wastes a whole issue-pick):

- **Already resolved on `main`?** An issue can go stale — fixed incidentally by
  a later change (e.g. a dependency bump). Re-read the issue body against current
  `main` before implementing.

  ```bash
  gh issue view <N> --json state,title,body | cat   # also: is it already closed?
  ```

- **Existing open PR for it?** Search open PRs for one that already addresses the
  issue, so you don't open a second, parallel PR for the same work.

  ```bash
  gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,body \
    --jq '.[] | select(((.body // "") | test("#<N>\\b")) or (.title | test("#<N>\\b"))) | "#\(.number) \(.title) [\(.headRefName)]"'
  ```

If an open PR already covers it, **drive that PR to clean** instead of
re-implementing (ask before pushing to a branch you didn't create). If `main`
already satisfies the issue, stand it down and report — don't open a no-op PR.

## Procedure

0. **Check the issue for an already-open PR.** Before writing any code, look at
   the issue itself for an open PR that already addresses it (one whose body
   says `Closes #<N>`). A parallel session — or an issues-sweep run on another
   machine — may already be on it; building anyway produces a duplicate PR.

   **GitHub:**
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,body \
     --jq '.[] | select((.body // "") | test("(Closes|Fixes|Resolves) #<N>\\b"; "i")) | "#\(.number) \(.title)"'
   ```

   **GitLab:**
   ```bash
   glab mr list --state opened --per-page=50 --output json 2>/dev/null \
     | jq -r '.[] | select((.description // "") | test("(Closes|Fixes|Resolves) #<N>\\b"; "i")) | "!\(.iid) \(.title)"'
   ```

   If an open PR already covers the issue, **review or extend it** instead of
   opening a competing one. This catches *in-flight* work; the merged/closed
   history below catches *settled* decisions.

1. **List recent merged MRs** touching the same area:

   **GitHub:**
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state merged --limit 20 --json number,title,headRefName | cat
   ```

   **GitLab:**
   ```bash
   glab mr list --merged --per-page=20 2>&1 | cat
   ```

2. **Identify relevant MRs** — look for titles/branches that relate to the
   files or subsystem you're about to modify.

3. **Read their descriptions** for rationale:

   **GitHub:**
   ```bash
   gh pr view <N> --json body --jq '.body' | cat
   ```

   **GitLab:**
   ```bash
   glab mr view <N> 2>&1 | cat
   ```

4. **Check for contradictions** — if a prior MR/PR explicitly chose approach A
   and you're about to implement approach B, understand *why* A was chosen.
   Common patterns:
   - MR/PR #X switched to strategy A for performance → don't blindly revert to B
   - MR/PR #Y removed code as dead → verify it's still dead before re-adding
   - MR/PR #Z added a guard/check → understand what it prevents before removing

5. **Document the relationship** in your commit message or MR/PR description:
   - "This resolves the incompatibility between #X and #Y"
   - "Supersedes the approach from #Z because [reason]"
   - "Preserves the intent of #X (no wasted resources) while also..."

## What to look for

- **Intentional trade-offs** documented in MR descriptions
- **Reverted MRs** — if something was tried and reverted, don't repeat it
  without understanding why it failed
- **Sequential MRs** that built on each other — your change might break an
  assumption from a later MR
- **Closed (not merged) MRs** — rejected approaches that shouldn't be retried

## Output

Report a brief summary to the user:
- Which MRs are relevant to the current work
- Any potential conflicts or trade-offs identified
- Confirmation that the proposed approach is compatible with prior decisions

If a conflict is found, surface it before writing code — don't implement first
and discover the regression later.
