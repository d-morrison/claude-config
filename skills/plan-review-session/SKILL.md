# plan-review-session

Convert a ranked list of common mistakes (e.g. from **grade-work**) into a
review session: a self-contained chapter that, for each common error, pairs a
*"common mistake"* callout with a worked correction, ordered most-impactful
first.

**Origin:** built from a midterm review chapter that distilled grading findings
into a new `chapters/<name>.qmd` in a Quarto course book.

## When to use

- You have a common-errors catalog and want classroom/handout material.
- The target is usually a Quarto course book, but the structure transfers to
  any Quarto/Markdown course site.

## Content structure

Per error category, in this order:

1. A descriptive `##` heading that states the *correct* principle (not the
   mistake) — e.g. "Nelson-Aalen estimates the cumulative hazard first, then
   exponentiates".
2. A `::: {.callout-warning}` block with a `## Common mistake` sub-heading
   describing what students did wrong (anonymized — patterns, never names).
3. A `::: {.solution}` block working through the correct approach with concrete
   numbers, reproducible R where it helps.

Order categories by **frequency × consequence**; lead each part with its most
consequential error. Close with a summary table cross-linking each mistake to
its section (`@sec-...`).

## Course-book conventions (the target book)

Match the existing chapters — read one first before writing.

- **Header:** front-matter with `title:` and the `html`/`revealjs`/`pdf`/`docx`
  format block, then the book's shared-config include (which pulls in the R
  setup and any LaTeX macros).
- **Math macros:** use the book's own math macros instead of raw LaTeX. Watch
  argument arity — some macros wrap their argument in parens, so for
  hand-written parens use the bare-operator variant.
- **Tables/figures:** use div form `::: {#tbl-...}` / `::: {#fig-...}` with the
  caption as the last line inside the div — *not* chunk-option `tbl-cap`.
- **Code chunks:** default `#| code-fold: true` for figure/table chunks; keep R
  simple and runnable.
- **Don't** start an included subfile with a heading; one source line per major
  phrase keeps diffs readable.

## Wiring a new chapter in

1. Add `- chapters/<name>.qmd` to the book's `_quarto.yml` under the right
   part. (Some books split the config across separate book and website YAMLs —
   if so, add the chapter to each `project: render:` list **and** to the
   `website: navbar:` menu.)
2. A chapter that is not in the render list won't build on the site — don't
   leave it stranded.

## Pre-commit checks (mandatory)

Run all three and fix what your change caused:

```sh
quarto render chapters/<name>.qmd --to html      # no errors/warnings
Rscript -e 'lintr::lint("chapters/<name>.qmd")'  # no lints in your code
Rscript -e 'res <- spelling::spell_check_files("chapters/<name>.qmd", ignore = readLines("inst/WORDLIST")); print(res)'
```

- Confirm the render has no unresolved cross-refs (grep the output HTML for
  `?@`) and that tables/computed values resolved.
- **Spellcheck gotcha:** local `spell_check_files` on `.qmd` does *not* strip
  in-math content, so it false-flags LaTeX macro tokens (`mathbf`, `tfrac`,
  `ge`, …). CI (clean container) does not flag these. So **only add genuine
  prose words** to `inst/WORDLIST` (e.g. `exponentiate`); do not pollute it with
  math macros.

## PR

- Branch off `origin/main` (`git checkout -b <name> origin/main`); never commit
  to `main` directly.
- Stage only your files — the working tree may carry unrelated dirty files
  (e.g. CRLF-only diffs); don't sweep them in with `git add -A`.
- Commit message ends with the Co-Authored-By line; PR body ends with the
  Generated-with-Claude line.
- After `gh pr create`, request a reviewer (see **request-pr-review**).
- Keep all commit/PR/issue text **anonymized** — no student names.

- **request-pr-review**, **r-pkg-spellcheck**, **sync-pr-branch** — the
  PR-hygiene skills this leans on.
