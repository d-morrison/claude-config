# migrate-discussion — move items between Discussions and Issues

Move a topic to the tracker where it belongs: a discussion that turned into a
concrete bug/task should become an **Issue**; an issue that's really a question,
idea, or support request should become a **Discussion**. Migration is a judgement
call — the "when helpful" part matters as much as the mechanics.

## When this fires

- User says "convert this issue to a discussion", "move #N to Discussions"
- User says "this discussion is really a bug — make it an issue", "open an issue
  from discussion #N"
- While triaging: an issue is generating open-ended debate with no actionable
  scope, or a discussion has converged on a concrete task someone will do

Don't migrate just because a thread is long. Migrate only when the item is
clearly in the wrong tracker.

## Decide first — is a move actually warranted?

| Move it **discussion → issue** when… | Move it **issue → discussion** when… |
|---|---|
| It's a concrete, reproducible bug | It's an open-ended question or support request |
| It's an actionable task with a clear "done" | It's brainstorming / a feature idea with no decision |
| Maintainers have decided to act on it | It needs community input before any work |
| It needs an assignee, label, milestone, or board | It has no actionable scope and no owner |

Leave it where it is when it's borderline, when both trackers fit, or when the
thread is active and a move would disrupt it. When unsure, ask the user — don't
migrate on a hunch.

## Prefer GitHub's native convert feature

GitHub has built-in one-click conversions, and they're the **best** path because
they preserve the original author, the full comment thread, and post an automatic
cross-reference:

- **Issue → Discussion:** on the issue, use the **"Convert to discussion"** menu
  item (issue sidebar / `...` menu), pick a category.
- **Discussion → Issue:** on the discussion, use **"Create issue from
  discussion"** (discussion `...` menu).

There is **no GraphQL mutation or `gh` subcommand** for either conversion — they
are UI-only. So when you (or the user) can reach the web UI, that's the move:
point the user at the button, or walk them through it, and you're done.

Use the recreate procedure below only when the native UI path isn't usable
(scripted/headless context, or the user explicitly wants it rebuilt).

## Fallback — recreate and cross-link

When you can't use the native convert feature, create the new item by hand,
preserve attribution, cross-link both ways, and close the original with a
pointer. Get the user's approval on the drafted new item before creating it —
this is outward-facing and hard to reverse.

### Discussion → Issue

1. Read the source discussion (see the **[discussions](../discussions/SKILL.md)**
   skill's read query) to capture its title, body, author, URL, and key
   comments.
2. Create the issue, quoting the original and linking back so authorship and
   context aren't lost:

   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title '<original title>' \
     --body 'Migrated from discussion <url> (opened by @<author>).

   <original body, quoted>

   Key points from the discussion thread:
   - @<login>: <summary>'
   ```

   In a remote/web session, use `mcp__github__issue_write` (`method: create`)
   with the same body instead of `gh`.
3. Comment on the discussion pointing at the new issue, then close it:

   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f discussionId='<discussion-id>' -f body='Moved to <issue-url> to track the actionable work.' -f query='
     mutation($discussionId: ID!, $body: String!) {
       addDiscussionComment(input: {discussionId: $discussionId, body: $body}) {
         comment { url }
       }
     }'

   gh api graphql -f discussionId='<discussion-id>' -f query='
     mutation($discussionId: ID!) {
       closeDiscussion(input: {discussionId: $discussionId, reason: OUTDATED}) {
         discussion { url closed }
       }
     }'
   ```

   `closeDiscussion` reasons are `RESOLVED`, `OUTDATED`, or `DUPLICATE`; use
   `OUTDATED` for a plain move.

### Issue → Discussion

1. Read the source issue (`gh issue view <N>` or `mcp__github__issue_read`) for
   its title, body, author, URL, and comments.
2. Look up the repository node ID and the target category ID (only certain
   categories exist per repo):

   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f owner='<owner>' -f repo='<repo>' -f query='
     query($owner: String!, $repo: String!) {
       repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
         id
         discussionCategories(first: 20) { nodes { id name isAnswerable } }
       }
     }'
   ```

3. Create the discussion, quoting the original and linking back:

   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f repositoryId='<repo-id>' -f categoryId='<category-id>' -f title='<original title>' -f body='Migrated from issue <url> (opened by @<author>).

   <original body, quoted>' -f query='
     mutation($repositoryId: ID!, $categoryId: ID!, $title: String!, $body: String!) {
       createDiscussion(input: {repositoryId: $repositoryId, categoryId: $categoryId, title: $title, body: $body}) {
         discussion { number url }
       }
     }'
   ```

4. Comment on the issue pointing at the new discussion, then close the issue as
   not planned:

   ```bash
   gh issue comment <N> --body 'Moved to <discussion-url> — this is better suited to Discussions.'
   gh issue close <N> --reason 'not planned'
   ```

   In a remote/web session, use `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` and
   `mcp__github__issue_write` (`method: update`, `state: closed`,
   `state_reason: not_planned`).

## Report back

Give the user both links (old and new) as clickable markdown links, say which
direction the migration went, and confirm the original was closed with a pointer.

## Relationship to other skills

- **[discussions](../discussions/SKILL.md)** — reads/answers discussion topics;
  this skill reuses its read query and hands topics back to it when a reply (not
  a move) is the right response.
- **[defer-issue](../defer-issue/SKILL.md)** — files a fresh follow-up issue for
  out-of-scope work; this skill *moves* an existing item between trackers.
- **[sup](../sup/SKILL.md)** — routes a report to the right destination
  (issue vs Discussions) on an *upstream* repo; same tracker-fit judgement, other
  people's repo.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Hand-rebuilding when the native **"Convert to discussion"** /
  **"Create issue from discussion"** button would do it — the native path keeps
  authorship, the thread, and cross-links; the fallback loses per-comment
  authorship.
- ❌ Migrating without cross-linking both ways — always leave a pointer on the
  original and reference the original in the new item.
- ❌ Closing the original **before** the new item exists — create first, link,
  then close, so nothing is orphaned.
- ❌ Creating the new item without the user's approval — outward-facing and hard
  to reverse.
- ❌ Migrating a borderline item on a hunch — when both trackers fit, leave it
  and ask.
