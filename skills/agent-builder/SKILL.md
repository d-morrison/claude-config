# agent-builder — author a new subagent definition (extend-first)

Create — or, preferably, *reuse* — a `.claude/agents/<name>.md` custom subagent
definition for a skill's fan-out step. This is `skill-builder`'s counterpart for
the other kind of file this repo ships: a persistent, harness-registered
**subagent persona**, not a user-invocable workflow. The prime directive
mirrors `skill-builder`'s: **don't scaffold a new agent until you've confirmed
no existing agent should be reused instead**, and a persistent agent file only
earns its keep when a plain inline `Agent()` prompt in the calling skill isn't
enough.

## When this fires

- "build an agent", "create a subagent", "make a new agent", "add an agent",
  "agent-builder"
- While authoring or extending a heavy, fan-out-shaped skill (see
  `when-to-orchestrate.md`) and the per-item worker needs a **fixed, narrower
  tool boundary** than the calling skill itself has — e.g. a detection or audit
  pass that must not be able to mutate anything, even by accident.
- Proactively, the same way `spot-skill-opportunities` proposes a new skill:
  notice the pattern, propose scaffolding an agent, don't build one unasked.

## Step 0 — Reuse or extend before you create (do this FIRST, always)

1. **List the existing agents and read their roles:**
   ```bash
   ls .claude/agents/
   ```
   Each one pairs 1:1 with a skill (`dependency-auditor` → `check-dependency-updates`,
   `hallucination-detector` → `purge-hallucinations`, `community-demand-scout` →
   `opposition-research`). Check whether an existing role already covers this
   concern under a different target — often the fix is parameterizing the
   *calling skill's* prompt to the existing agent, not building a new persona.
2. **Ask whether this needs a persistent file at all.** An inline `Agent()` /
   `agent()` prompt (see `skill-builder`'s "If the skill fans out to subagents"
   section) is enough unless: (a) more than one skill would spawn the same
   persona, or (b) the harness-enforced tool restriction is itself load-bearing
   — e.g. guaranteeing a detection pass *can't* accidentally write, which an
   inline prompt can't guarantee (the calling skill's own tools still apply).
3. **State explicitly: reuse, extend, or new** — and why — before writing a line.

## Anatomy of an agent definition

```
.claude/agents/<name>.md
```

```yaml
---
name: <name>                 # kebab-case, role-noun compound: <domain>-<role>
description: <what it audits/detects/scouts>, what it lacks (Edit/Write/Bash)
  and why, and which skill spawns it as its fan-out worker
tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch    # comma-separated STRING, not a
                                            # YAML list (unlike skills'
                                            # `allowed-tools:`)
---
```

Body shape: an opening line "You are the `<role>` half of the `<skill>` skill.",
a numbered procedure for what to check/verify/mine, an explicit output-shape
spec (what to return, in what order), and a closing reminder of exactly which
mutating tools are absent and why avoiding shell-based writes with the tools it
does have is instruction-level discipline, not harness-enforced. Match the tone
and structure of the three existing agents — they read almost as a template.

## Conventions (match the existing family)

- **Naming:** `<domain>-<role>` compound noun (`dependency-auditor`,
  `hallucination-detector`, `community-demand-scout`) — not a verb phrase, not
  a generic name like `helper` or `worker`.
- **Default to read-only.** Omit `Edit` and `Write` from `tools:` unless the
  agent's entire purpose is to mutate files (rare — none of the three existing
  agents do). If `Bash` is present without `Edit`/`Write`, say explicitly in the
  `description` that `Bash` could still write and that avoiding write-capable
  shell commands is instruction-level, not harness-enforced — `dependency-auditor`
  and `hallucination-detector` both carry this caveat (they have `Bash`).
  `community-demand-scout` sidesteps the issue entirely by omitting `Bash` from
  `tools:` — prefer that when the agent's job doesn't need shell access at all.
- **Pair 1:1 with the skill that spawns it.** Name that skill in the opening
  clause of `description` ("Read-only audit pass for check-dependency-updates
  (cdu)").
- **Write the prompt as if the calling skill's `SKILL.md` doesn't exist** — a
  spawned agent never sees it. Restate every needed discipline (the exact
  query, source priorities, output shape) inside the agent file itself, the
  same rule `skill-builder`'s subagent-fanning section states for inline
  prompts.
- **No registry to update.** Agents are auto-discovered from `.claude/agents/`
  (mirrors skills' auto-discovery from `skills/`) — adding the file is enough
  for the harness to expose it as a `subagent_type`. There is currently no
  `validate-skills.py`-equivalent lint for `.claude/agents/`, so hand-check:
  `name:` matches the filename, `tools:` is a comma-separated string (not a
  YAML list), and `description` states the role, its tool limits, and the
  calling skill.

## Can an agent build another agent?

Mechanically, yes: any subagent granted `Edit`/`Write` (the default
`general-purpose` agent, or a custom agent you don't restrict) can write a new
`.claude/agents/*.md` file exactly like any other file — nothing in the harness
singles out agent-definition files as unwritable. But this repo doesn't
delegate agent-authoring that way. Building an agent is an *authoring* task,
and every authoring task in this corpus — including `skill-builder` itself —
runs in the **main session**, not a spawned worker, so a human-in-the-loop
stays on the naming, tool-scoping, and reuse-check decisions in Step 0. The
fan-out workers this skill creates are deliberately read-only in part so they
*can't* self-modify or spawn siblings unsupervised. Keep authoring inline;
reserve spawned agents for the narrow, read-only, single-purpose jobs the
existing three model.

## Register the new agent with its calling skill

There's no central agent list to update (see above) — "registering" a new
agent means updating the **one skill** that spawns it:

1. Add the fan-out call in that skill's procedure — `Agent(subagent_type:
   "<name>", ...)`, or inside a `Workflow` script, `agent(prompt, {agentType:
   "<name>"})`.
2. Name the `.claude/agents/<name>.md` path explicitly in the skill body (grep
   `check-dependency-updates`, `purge-hallucinations`, or `opposition-research`
   for the pattern to match).
3. If the skill's procedure names a GitHub MCP tool the agent will call,
   register it in `tool-mappings.yml` per `skill-builder`'s rule — the same
   possible-hallucination risk applies to agent-spawning skills.

## Ship it

Agent files and skills both live in the ai-config repo — never local-only.
Branch + PR + ARDI, the same flow as `skill-builder`.

> **In a worktree session, the same hazard applies as in `skill-builder`'s
> ship-it:** the repo toplevel below is the MAIN checkout, not your worktree.
> `~/.claude/skills` symlinks into the main `ai-config` checkout, so `git -C
> ~/.claude/skills/… rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns the main repo root —
> often on another session's branch. Don't `cd` there and don't pass that path
> to Write/Edit. Author `.claude/agents/<name>.md` and the calling skill's
> `SKILL.md` in your **worktree's own** checkout instead, and confirm with
> `git branch --show-current` before committing. See `skill-builder`'s ship-it
> section for the full explanation.

```bash
cd "$(git -C ~/.claude/skills/agent-builder rev-parse --show-toplevel)"   # ai-config root
git fetch origin main && git checkout -b add-<name>-agent origin/main
# write .claude/agents/<name>.md, and update the one calling skill's SKILL.md
# The `validate` CI job runs these four — run all four locally before pushing,
# same as skill-builder — since this also touches the calling skill's SKILL.md:
python3 scripts/validate-skills.py   # sanity-checks skills/, not agents/ yet — still run it
python3 scripts/check-links.py       # relative links in the updated calling skill
python3 scripts/check-vendored-drift.py
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2@0.22.1   # markdown style on the updated skill's SKILL.md
git add .claude/agents/<name>.md skills/<calling-skill>/SKILL.md   # stage only what you touched
git commit -m "agents: add <name> — <summary>"
git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create --fill
```

Then, as explicit steps:

1. **Request the reviewer:** `gh pr edit --add-reviewer d-morrison` (see
   `request-pr-review`).
2. **Drive to clean:** run `ardi` on the new PR until the verdict has zero
   findings.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`skill-builder`** — the skill-authoring sibling; this is its subagent-file
  counterpart. Use `skill-builder` when the new capability is a user-invocable
  workflow; use this one when it's a read-only fan-out worker a skill spawns.
- **`spot-skill-opportunities`** — recognizes when a *skill* is needed; the
  same in-the-moment recognition applies to noticing a heavy skill's fan-out
  step would benefit from a dedicated persona instead of an inline prompt —
  hand off here for that case.
- **`ums` / `record-learnings`** — when a session reveals that a fan-out step
  needs a tighter, reusable worker persona (not just a skill gap), route here
  instead of, or alongside, `skill-builder`.
- **`heal-skill`** — repairs a skill that misfired; if the root cause is
  actually the spawned agent's prompt or tool-scoping (wrong persona, too-loose
  tools), fix the `.claude/agents/*.md` file via this skill's conventions
  rather than editing the calling skill.
- **`link-skills`** — the cross-link auditor for skills, though it currently
  scans only `skills/` and doesn't check `.claude/agents/`. Until it's extended
  to cover agent files, manually verify that a skill naming a custom agent is
  named back in that agent's `description`.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Creating a new agent when an existing persona, parameterized differently,
  would do.
- ❌ Giving a read-only fan-out worker `Edit`/`Write` "just in case."
- ❌ Writing the agent's system prompt assuming it inherits the calling
  skill's text — restate every needed discipline explicitly.
- ❌ `tools:` written as a YAML list — agent frontmatter uses a plain
  comma-separated string, unlike skills' `allowed-tools:`.
- ❌ Delegating the authoring itself to a spawned agent instead of doing it in
  the main session — naming, tool-scoping, and the reuse-check need a
  human-in-the-loop.
- ❌ Leaving the new agent unreferenced by any skill — an orphaned
  `.claude/agents/*.md` file with nothing to spawn it.
- ❌ Leaving the change local-only, or pushing straight to main.
