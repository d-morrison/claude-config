description: "Simplify code where feasible without feature loss — prune dead code paths, remove unreachable branches, collapse unnecessary indirection, and simplify variable assignments that can never take their fallback values. Use after any refactor that changes invocation context, after removing a feature, or when reviewing code that has accumulated historical cruft."

# simplify

After any change that narrows the invocation context (e.g., a job now only
runs under branch pipelines, a function is only called from one site, a
config option is removed), sweep for dead code that the change made
unreachable.

## When this fires

- Automatically after any refactor that changes how code is invoked
- When asked to "simplify", "clean up", "prune dead code"
- During review when spotting unreachable paths
- After removing a feature flag or configuration option

## What to look for

1. **Dead branches** — `if` conditions that can never be true given the new
   invocation context. Example: checking for `merge_request_event` when the
   job only runs on branch pipelines.

2. **Unnecessary fallbacks** — `${VAR:-fallback}` where `VAR` is always set
   in the current context. Simplify to just `$VAR`.

3. **Redundant guards** — checks that duplicate a constraint already enforced
   by the caller (e.g., a rule in the CI template already ensures an MR
   exists, so the script's "no MR found" check is belt-and-suspenders — keep
   it for defense-in-depth, but remove the *comment* claiming it's the
   primary gate).

4. **Vestigial comments** — comments describing behavior that no longer
   applies. Stale comments are worse than no comments.

5. **Collapsed conditionals** — an `if/else` where one branch is now
   unreachable can be collapsed to just the reachable branch.

6. **Unused variables** — assignments whose values are never read downstream.

## Decision criteria

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Code is unreachable AND no consumer could reach it | Remove |
| Code is unreachable under shipped config but a consumer *could* override | Keep with a comment explaining why |
| Fallback value is never used but adds clarity | Keep (readability > minimalism) |
| Comment describes removed behavior | Remove or rewrite |
| Defense-in-depth guard (redundant but safe) | Keep the guard, update the comment |

## Process

1. Identify the narrowed context (what changed about how this code is called)
2. Trace each conditional/fallback to determine if it's still reachable
3. For each dead path: remove it or document why it's retained
4. Run syntax checks / tests after pruning
5. Note the simplification in the commit message (e.g., "remove unreachable
   merge_request_event path — job now only runs on branch pipelines")

## Principle

> The best code is code that doesn't exist. Every line is a liability —
> it must be read, understood, maintained, and tested. Remove what you can;
> document what you keep.
