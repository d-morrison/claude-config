# request-pr-review

After creating any PR, request `d-morrison` as a reviewer. The user said
"you should always request my review after creating PRs" on 2026-05-15 —
without an explicit review request, the PR sits in their inbox without
notification.

## When to run

- Immediately after `gh pr create` succeeds, in the same response.
- When the user asks you to "request review" on an existing PR.

## Command

```sh
gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<num>/requested_reviewers \
  -f "reviewers[]=d-morrison"
```

You can get `<owner>/<repo>` from `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`
and `<num>` from the PR URL returned by `gh pr create`.

## Edge cases

- **PR author is d-morrison.** GitHub returns HTTP 422 with
  `"Review cannot be requested from pull request author"`. Surface this
  explicitly to the user — don't silently swallow the error. They can
  self-assign via the UI if needed, but the review request can't go through
  the API.

- **Other reviewers already requested.** The endpoint adds to the existing
  list rather than replacing it, so this is safe to run alongside
  pre-configured CODEOWNERS or workflow-added reviewers.

## Scope

Applies by default to all GitHub repos. If the user tells you a specific
repo shouldn't auto-request d-morrison, honor that override per-repo via a
project-level memory.
