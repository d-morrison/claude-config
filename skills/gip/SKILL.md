# GIP — Grab Issues in Parallel

Grab a batch of open issues and work them **at the same time** — one subagent
per issue, each in its own git worktree, each running the full grab-issue flow
(claim → check history → open draft PR → implement → mark ready → ARDI to
clean). Then assemble one combined report.

This is the **parallel** counterpart to [`gii`](../gii/SKILL.md), which is
**deliberately serial**. The whole job of this skill is to safely lift that
serialization — and that is only safe for issues that are **provably
independent**. Read *The independence gate* before fanning anything out; it is
the load-bearing part.

## When this fires

- "gip", "grab issues in parallel", "do these issues concurrently"
- "work several issues at once", "parallelize the backlog",
  "fan out the issue queue", "spin up a worker per issue"

It does **not** fire for a single issue (use [`gi`](../gi/SKILL.md)) or when the
issues are interdependent / stacked (use [`gii`](../gii/SKILL.md), which stacks).

## Why `gii` is serial — and when parallel is safe

`gii` runs one issue at a time on purpose, for three reasons:

1. **Base-branch stacking** — a later issue's branch may depend on a prior MR
   that hasn't merged yet, so it must branch from that MR's tip, not `main`.
2. **Same-file conflicts** — two issues that edit the same files produce
   guaranteed merge conflicts if worked in parallel.
3. **Shared working tree** — a single checkout can't hold two in-progress
   branches at once.

Parallel is safe only when **(1) and (2) don't apply** and **(3) is removed by
worktree isolation**. So this skill fans out **only the independent subset** and
sends everything else back to the serial path.

## Procedure

### 0. Establish context (orchestrator, once)

Detect the forge (GitHub `gh` / GitLab `glab`) from `git remote get-url origin`
and note the default branch. Resolve `<owner>/<repo>` once so you can pass it to
every subagent. In a remote/web session, `gh` may be absent — use the GitHub MCP
tools instead (e.g. `mcp__github__add_issue_comment`,
`mcp__github__create_pull_request`, `mcp__github__search_pull_requests`).

### 1. Enumerate and triage (orchestrator)

List the open issues and prioritize them exactly as [`gi`](../gi/SKILL.md) does.
Decide which issues are in scope for this batch (respect any the user named).

### 2. The independence gate (orchestrator — do NOT skip)

Partition the in-scope issues into an **independent set** (safe to parallelize)
and a **dependent remainder** (must stay serial). An issue belongs in the
independent set only if **all** hold:

- **No stacking dependency** — it can branch straight from `origin/main`; it
  doesn't need another in-flight issue's unmerged branch as its base.
- **No file overlap** — its likely touched files don't intersect any other
  in-batch issue's likely files. When in doubt, read the issues and sketch each
  one's probable file footprint; if two plausibly collide, treat them as
  dependent.
- **Not blocked** — no "blocked by #N" / "depends on #N" marker pointing at
  another open item.

Anything failing a check drops to the **dependent remainder**. If two issues
overlap only with each other, keep one in the independent set and defer the
other to the remainder — don't fan out both.

> **When unsure, serialize.** A false "independent" call costs a merge conflict
> and a confused review; a false "dependent" call only costs some wall-clock
> time. Bias toward the remainder.

If the independent set has **0 or 1** issues, there's nothing to parallelize —
hand off to [`gii`](../gii/SKILL.md) (serial) and stop here.

### 3. Pick the concurrency cap (orchestrator)

Fan out **at most N at once** (default **N = 3**). Bound it because every
subagent pushes commits, triggers a review workflow, and polls for the result —
too many at once swamps shared CI runners and the review bot (the same
runner-contention reason [`ardia`](../ardia/SKILL.md) processes PRs one at a
time). If the independent set is larger than N, run it in waves of N.

### 4. Fan out — one worktree-isolated subagent per issue (concurrent)

Spawn the wave **in a single message with multiple `Agent` calls** so they run
at once. Give **every** subagent `isolation: "worktree"` — that hands each one
its own working directory over the shared `.git`, so concurrent edits, branches,
and commits never collide on one checkout. (This is the subagent form of the
same isolation [`session-lock`](../session-lock/SKILL.md) sets up for
independent top-level sessions.)

A subagent starts **fresh** — it sees only the prompt you hand it, not this
skill file — so **inline the entire per-issue procedure**. Don't point it at
`gi`/`ardi`; restate the steps. Fill in `<N>`, `<title>`, `<owner>`, `<repo>`,
and the default branch for each issue:

> Work GitHub issue **#<N>** ("<title>") in `<owner>/<repo>` end to end, on your
> own branch, in this worktree. You are one of several parallel workers — stay
> entirely within this worktree and touch only files relevant to this issue.
>
> 1. **Claim it** so no one else double-works it: post a brief "Working on this
>    --- paws off until I'm done." comment on the issue
>    (`gh issue comment <N> --body "..."`, or the MCP
>    `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` equivalent in a remote session).
> 2. **Check history** — before writing code, scan merged/closed PRs that
>    touched the same area so you don't undo past work or reintroduce a fixed
>    bug (`gh pr list --state all --search "<keywords>"`). If a past PR already
>    solved this, stop and report that instead of re-doing it.
> 3. **Branch from current `<default-branch>`**: `git fetch origin
>    <default-branch> -q && git checkout -b <slug> origin/<default-branch>`.
>    Use a descriptive `<slug>`.
> 4. **Open the draft PR now** — before implementing, so this worktree's work
>    is visible to the other parallel workers and no one double-grabs the issue
>    (see [`pr-on-claim`](../../shared/workflow/pr-on-claim.md)). Give the branch
>    a diff with an empty commit, push, and open a **draft** PR into
>    `<default-branch>` referencing `Closes #<N>`:
>    `git commit --allow-empty -m "start: <title> (closes #<N>)"`, then
>    `git push -u origin HEAD` (retry with backoff on a network error), then
>    `gh pr create --draft …` (or `mcp__github__create_pull_request` with
>    `draft: true`). A draft doesn't trigger the review bot on an empty diff.
> 5. **Implement** the change. Keep the diff focused on this issue only —
>    do **not** touch files another issue owns. Follow the repo's conventions
>    (its `CLAUDE.md` / lab manual). Run the repo's pre-commit checks
>    (render / lint / spell / tests) and fix what they flag.
> 6. **Commit and push** the implementation onto the draft PR with a clear
>    message referencing the issue (`Closes #<N>` so the PR auto-closes it),
>    then **mark the PR ready for review** — `gh pr ready <N>` (or
>    `mcp__github__update_pull_request` with `draft: false`). Marking it ready
>    is what kicks off review.
> 7. **ARDI to clean** — drive the PR to a clean review verdict: read the
>    LATEST review, Address every finding / Rebut what's wrong / Defer
>    out-of-scope items to a tracked issue, push, re-request review, repeat
>    until zero findings and CI is green. Don't stop at "review-clean, needs
>    approval."
>
> Return: the issue number, the PR number + URL, how many ARDI rounds it took,
> the final status (clean / blocked / needs-input), and a one-line summary of
> what you changed. If you hit something ambiguous or architecturally
> significant, stop and report it instead of guessing.

Keep the cheap, once-per-run setup (enumerate, triage, the independence gate)
in the orchestrator — never have each subagent re-do it.

### 5. Work the dependent remainder serially (orchestrator)

After the parallel wave, run the **dependent remainder** through the normal
serial [`gii`](../gii/SKILL.md) loop — it stacks branches and handles same-file
ordering correctly. Don't try to parallelize it. GII keeps going through that
remainder without pausing for merges — a clean-but-unmerged base is stacked on,
not waited on (see [`stack-dont-pause`](../../shared/workflow/stack-dont-pause.md)).

### 6. Combined report (orchestrator)

Collect each subagent's returned row and print one summary:

```
## GIP Session Summary — <timestamp>

### Parallel wave (independent issues)
| # | Issue | PR | Rounds | Status |
|---|-------|----|--------|--------|
| 1 | [#12](url) | [#30](url) | 2 | ✅ Clean |
| 2 | [#15](url) | [#31](url) | 1 | ✅ Clean |

### Serial remainder (dependent / overlapping issues)
| # | Issue | PR | Rounds | Status |
|---|-------|----|--------|--------|
| 3 | [#18](url) | [#32](url) | 3 | ✅ Clean (stacked on #30) |
```

Link every PR (`[#N](url)`, never bare `#N`). Call out anything a worker left
blocked or flagged for input, and note any stack/merge order from the serial
remainder.

## Graceful degradation to serial

If the `Agent` tool isn't available in the session, you can't fan out — fall
back to [`gii`](../gii/SKILL.md) and work the whole in-scope set serially. The
per-issue work and the final report are the same; only the concurrency is lost.

## Orchestration

GIP already fans out --- it is the manual form of this pattern, one
worktree-isolated subagent per provably-independent issue. When the harness
supports it, prefer driving that fan-out through a **Workflow** (per
`shared/workflow/when-to-orchestrate.md`): the deterministic pipeline gives each
issue the same implement --- open-PR --- ARDI chain plus worktree isolation,
rather than ad-hoc subagents. The independence gate and the concurrency cap stay
unchanged --- only provably-independent issues run at once, and still capped (the
shared-runner limit the fragment describes). Launch directly when an opt-in
signal is present; otherwise propose with a cost estimate first.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`gii`** / **`gis`** — the **serial** counterpart and the safe fallback. GIP
  is GII with the independent subset lifted out and run concurrently; everything
  GIP can't prove independent goes back through GII. (gii : gip :: the write
  loop stays series, the safe subset fans out.)
- **`gi`** / **`grab-issue`** — the per-issue flow each subagent runs (claim →
  history → open draft PR → implement → mark ready → ARDI). GIP restates it
  inline because subagents start fresh.
- **`pr-on-claim`** — the rule behind each subagent's step 4: open the draft PR
  up front so parallel workers see the in-flight issue before implementing.
- **`gia`** — clears the whole queue (clean open PRs, then work issues); compose
  GIP into its issue phase when that phase's issues are independent.
- **`ardi`** — each subagent ARDIs its own PR to clean.
- **`ardia`** — the whole-queue *PR* write loop; it stays **series** for the
  same runner-contention reason GIP caps its concurrency. Contrast, not overlap.
- **`pr-status-all`** — the read-only fan-out exemplar (one subagent per PR).
  GIP is the *write* fan-out: same one-subagent-per-unit shape, but it needs
  worktree isolation and an independence gate because its units mutate state.
- **`check-history`** — each subagent runs it before implementing.
- **`session-lock`** — the worktree isolation GIP gives each subagent is the
  subagent form of the isolation session-lock sets up for top-level sessions.
- **`defer-issue`** / **`split-concerns`** — used inside a subagent when its
  issue spawns sub-tasks or grows too large.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Fanning out issues that touch the same files — guaranteed merge conflicts.
  Run them serially (gii) instead.
- ❌ Fanning out a stacked issue whose base is another unmerged in-batch branch.
  It belongs in the serial remainder.
- ❌ Skipping `isolation: "worktree"` — parallel subagents in one checkout
  clobber each other's edits and branches.
- ❌ Skipping the independence gate and parallelizing the whole backlog
  blindly — the failure mode `gii` exists to avoid.
- ❌ Unbounded fan-out — swamps CI runners and the review bot. Cap at ~3 and run
  in waves.
- ❌ Writing the subagent prompt as if it inherits this skill's text — it
  doesn't; restate the full per-issue procedure inline.
- ❌ Re-running the triage / independence gate inside each subagent — that's
  once-per-run orchestrator work.
