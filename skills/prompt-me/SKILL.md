description: >
  Surface the single most pressing open question still waiting on user
  input — or, with a numeric argument, that many of the most pressing ones
  — instead of leaving it buried under unrelated work in the transcript.
  Use when asked to 'prompt me', 'pm', 'prompt me 3', 'pm 3', 'what are you
  waiting on me for', 'what do you need from me', 'remind me what you
  asked', or '/prompt-me [N]'. For every open question at once, use
  `prompt-me-all` / `pma` instead.

# prompt-me

Sweep the conversation for questions that were posed to the user but never
answered, rank them by how much they're blocking, and surface the most
pressing one — or a requested number of the most pressing ones. Long
sessions bury a question asked several turns back under unrelated work;
this skill surfaces it again instead of leaving it stranded.

## When this fires

- Explicit invocation: `/prompt-me`, `/pm`, "prompt me", "pm".
- With a count: `/prompt-me 3`, `pm 3`, "prompt me the top 2".
- The user asks a variant like "what are you waiting on me for?", "what do
  you need from me?", "did you ask me something?", or "remind me what you
  asked".
- For **every** open question with no cap, that's a different skill:
  `prompt-me-all` / `pma` — see below.

## Step 1 — Find candidate questions

Scan back through the current conversation (not prior sessions) for anything
that reads as a question directed at the user:

- Direct questions in your own prior messages (ending in `?`, or phrased as
  a request for a decision, confirmation, or missing information).
- Any pending `AskUserQuestion` call that was skipped, dismissed, or never
  resolved.
- Conditional asks embedded in a longer message ("let me know if...", "should
  I... or...", "confirm before I...").

Exclude:

- Questions the user already answered, even indirectly (a later message that
  makes the answer clear moots the question — don't re-ask it).
- Rhetorical questions or ones you answered yourself in the same message.
- Questions from a different task the user explicitly dropped or superseded.

## Step 2 — Rank by how pressing each one is

Order the surviving questions from most to least pressing:

1. **Blocking** questions first — ones that stop the next step of active work
   until answered outrank purely informational asks.
2. Within the same tier, **more recent** beats older — a question asked
   moments ago is more likely to still be live than one from many turns back.

## Step 3 — Select and present

- **No argument**: surface only the single most pressing question.
- **Numeric argument `N`**: surface the top `N`, most-pressing-first.
- If the count requested exceeds the number of open questions, just present
  what exists — don't pad the list or manufacture filler.

For each item, give enough context to answer cold — don't just repeat the
bare question if the surrounding detail (options, why it matters, what's
blocked on it) got lost upstream.

```
Still waiting on you for:
1. <question>, restated with the context that pins it down
```

(Add more numbered items only when a count `> 1` was requested.)

If nothing is actually pending, say so plainly ("nothing open right now")
rather than manufacturing a question to fill the list.

## Step 4 — Don't re-decide anything

This skill only restates; it never guesses an answer or picks a default to
unblock itself. If a question turns out to be stale (events since have made
it moot), say that instead of listing it, but don't silently drop a question
just because answering it looks hard.
