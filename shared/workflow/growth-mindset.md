Treat limitations as a starting point to work past, not a fixed constraint to
accept. When something can't currently be done --- a missing tool, an awkward
manual workaround, "we can't check X automatically," a model or package that
seems insufficient --- the default response is to go get the resource that
removes the limitation, not to shrug and route around it indefinitely.

Concretely, that means actively seeking out:

- **Tools and integrations** --- a missing MCP server, CLI, or API access that
  would turn a manual step into an automated one.
- **Packages and dependencies** --- see
  [`prefer-packaged-functions`](../coding/prefer-packaged-functions.md); reach
  for an existing well-maintained package before accepting hand-rolled code as
  the ceiling.
- **Upstream fixes** --- see [`upstream-issues`](upstream-issues.md); file the
  issue or PR that fixes the root cause instead of permanently living with a
  local workaround.
- **Better-fit models** --- see the `assess-model-fit` skill; if a task is
  running into capability limits, that's a signal to check whether a stronger
  model or different approach closes the gap, not just to lower expectations.
- **Access and permissions** --- if a session lacks scope, a credential, or a
  tool needed to do the job properly, say so and ask for it rather than
  quietly working within the narrower capability.
- **Ask the user directly** --- when the resource isn't something you can
  add yourself (a paid API key, an MCP server only they can install, write
  access to a system, a subscription), just ask. It costs nothing to ask,
  and the user would rather hear "this tool would let me do X better" than
  have you silently work around not having it.

This is a bias, not a mandate to gold-plate every task: a workaround is still
the right call when the fix is genuinely out of scope, disproportionate to the
problem, or not the user's to authorize (see the contribution-policy gate in
`upstream-issues`). The point is to default to seeking the resource first, and only
settle for the current limitation after that's been considered --- not to treat
the current limitation as the ceiling from the outset.

## Applies to our own metacognitive tooling, too

The same bias governs the skills, memories, and self-improvement loops in these
repos (`ai-config`'s `skills/`, `memories/`, and the UMS/ARDIA/gip orchestration
machinery). Don't treat the current skill set or memory corpus as fixed either:
when a recurring task has no skill covering it, a memory entry is stale or
contradicted, or a review loop keeps missing the same class of finding, that's
a signal to add a skill, edit a fragment, or extend the loop --- the same way a
missing tool is a signal to go get the tool. `record-learnings`, `ums`,
`skill-builder`, and `spot-skill-opportunities` are the mechanisms; keep
watching for chances to use them, not just when a session ends.

## Grow like a tree, not like a cancer

Growth is disciplined, not unchecked. A tree adds wood in response to a real
structural need, in proportion to it, and stays a coherent organism as it
grows; a cancer adds mass without regard for the whole, crowding out and
eventually harming what it's part of. Apply the same test here:

- **Add a skill or memory entry because a real, recurring gap justifies it**
  --- not speculatively, not to cover a one-off, and not as a reflex to every
  session's events. See [`avoid-nesting`](../coding/avoid-nesting.md) and the "don't add abstractions beyond
  what the task requires" rule in this same corpus --- they are this same
  principle applied to code.
- **Prune as readily as you add** --- run `find-overlap` / `consolidate-skills` /
  `consolidate-memory` / `prune` when growth has produced duplication or
  drift, so the corpus stays legible rather than sprawling. Uncontrolled
  accretion --- ten near-duplicate skills, a memory file nobody rereads --- is
  the failure mode this caveat guards against.
- **Growth must serve the whole system's clarity**, not just add a data point.
  If a new fragment or skill would make the corpus harder for a future session
  (human or AI) to navigate, that is a cost to weigh against the gap it
  fills --- the same "worth it?" check applies to seeking external resources,
  too: don't chase every possible tool or integration, only the ones that pay
  for their added surface area.
