When iterating on a PR with a reviewer, **address every in-scope flagged item**,
regardless of severity label. The reviewer's "Not a blocker", "minor", "nit",
"optional", "consider", or "if you want" labels are for prioritization, not a
free pass for the implementer.

For each flagged item, do exactly one of:

1. **Fix it in this PR.** The default path --- most nits are 1--3 line changes.
2. **Defer to a tracked issue.** Only when the fix expands the PR's scope (new
   feature, broader refactor, separate concern) or the requester has explicitly
   said this PR shouldn't grow. File a follow-up issue and reference it in a PR
   comment so the item isn't lost.

Then trigger another review and repeat until the PR is **fully clean** --- zero
flagged items under any heading, no "non-blocking", "harmless", "minor
observation", or "could improve" sections. "Looks good" / "no findings" /
"approved" with no follow-on bullets is the bar. Resolve every inline review
thread along the way, leaving only the final all-clear exchange.

Do **not** report "ready to merge with one minor nit noted" / "harmless as-is" /
"can address if you want" --- that hedging just pushes triage back to the
requester. If after 3--4 rounds the reviewer keeps generating new nits each
cycle (asymptotic noise), surface that and ask whether to keep going or accept
the current state.

**When a finding is a pattern (a formatting/style rule broken in one spot),
apply it everywhere it recurs in the same file, not just the flagged line.**
A reviewer that flags one inconsistent list-item format is telling you about
the rule, not just that one item --- fix every occurrence in the same file that
breaks it in the same pass, rather than waiting for the reviewer to flag each
occurrence in a separate round. Re-scan the whole changed file for the same
pattern before pushing the fix.
